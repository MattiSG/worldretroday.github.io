    <p>
      Coderetreats are run by volunteers who want to help out
      their local developer community.
       Hosts handle all of the logistics,
       and facilitators guide participants through the exercises.

    <p>
      Coderetreats are easy to organize and facilitate.  Most of all, they are a lot of fun and a great way
      to meet other developers in your area!
